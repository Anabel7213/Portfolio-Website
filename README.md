# Portfolio Website
This website is entirely fictitious and is the demonstration of everything I've learned about Front-End Development in the past month, that's why some areas are not fully implemented. I have also designed on the go and without Figma prototypes unlike I usually do, so the website's UI/UX might seem quite simple, however my focus was on the functionality and application of everything I've learned.

It is entirely responsive, that is it works across all platforms and devices. In the most recent update I've added animations to certain elements, as well as the pop up forms start are triggered with the help of JavaScript.

Additionally, submitted data is not stored anywhere including locally because back-end development is currently ouside of scope of this project.
